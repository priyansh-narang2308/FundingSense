## 🌟 Key Features

### 🔍 Real-World Evidence Retrieval (Live Web Search)
Unlike traditional AI tools that rely on stale training data, FundingSense uses **Gemini 2.0 Web Search Grounding**. It crawls 2024-2025 news, policy documents, and venture databases in real-time to find:
- Actual active investors (Peak XV, Blume, Accel, etc.).
- Recent funding rounds and market trends.
- Up-to-date government policies and regulatory changes.

### 🇮🇳 Bharat-First Multilingual UI
FundingSense is built for the diverse Indian startup ecosystem, supporting **English + 7 major Indian languages**:
- **Hindi (हिंदी)**, **Bengali (বাংলা)**, **Tamil (தமிழ்)**, **Telugu (తెలుగు)**, **Marathi (मराठी)**, **Gujarati (ગુજરાતી)**, and **Kannada (ಕನ್ನಡ)**.
- **Dynamic AI Translation**: Historical summaries and real-time insights are automatically translated into your preferred language using our custom-built AI translation engine.

### 📊 Deep Funding Fit Analysis
- **Fit Score & Confidence**: Proprietary scoring algorithm that calculates the alignment between your startup and current market sentiment.
- **Why This Fits/Does Not Fit**: Bulleted, evidence-backed reasons explaining the AI's reasoning.
- **Recommended Investors**: A curated list of 3-5 VCs with specific reasons for their match.

### 📁 Evidence Vault
Every analysis is backed by an "Evidence Vault" containing:
- **News articles** with direct URLs.
- **Policy documents** and datasets.
- **Usage Tags** explaining exactly how each piece of data influenced your report.
